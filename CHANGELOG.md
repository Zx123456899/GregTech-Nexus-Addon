# Changelog

## [0.3.2-dev] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Nexus ME Hypercore / AE2 Integration**:
  - Added `Crafting CPU Interface` as the AE2 bridge part for the Nexus ME Hypercore multiblock.
  - Added AE2 virtual Crafting CPU cluster support for the Nexus ME Hypercore, including saved CPU state and relog recovery.
  - Added AE2 mixins for Nexus virtual CPU discovery, large CPU storage formatting, large co-processor formatting, and infinite-value display.
  - Added generated assets, lang entries, and item/model coverage for the Crafting CPU Interface and Infinite Cell Component.
  - Added the Nexus ME Hypercore structure file integration based on the GTOCore ME Computer Core style.
- **Primitive Distillation Tower**:
  - Added the primitive steam distillation tower controller with GT-Not-Leisure-inspired structure behavior.
  - Added MV-and-below recipe restriction and 75% steam consumption behavior.
  - Added tooltip text explaining the 6-fluid-output limit and steam efficiency.
- **Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Line**:
  - Added fixed two-thread processing support to the `Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Oven`, allowing two different furnace recipes to run at the same time.
  - Added clearer tooltips for the Dimensionally Transcendent steam machines, including threads, speed, parallelism, and structure notes.
- **Recipes and Progression**:
  - Added missing recipes for coordinate cards, additional pattern buffer tiers, and thread hatches through UHV.
  - Added generated models/assets for the new steam-era machines, casings, and the primitive spacetime distortion device item.
- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Added dedicated Eye of Wood structure data, renderer support, localization, and richer player-facing tooltip text based on the original Twist Space Technology behavior.

### Changed
- **Nexus ME Hypercore / AE2 Integration**:
  - Reworked the Nexus ME Hypercore structure predicates to accept only the required Crafting CPU Interface and Parallel Hatch where appropriate, removing Pattern Buffer acceptance.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore casing/render texture from Magtech casing to GTCEu Nonconducting Casing.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore module counting to use the formed multiblock pattern cache, fixing rotated or larger structure undercounting.
  - Updated Nexus ME Hypercore controller UI to use full labels while abbreviating only large numeric values.
  - Updated AE2 Crafting CPU list formatting so Nexus CPUs use compact storage and co-processor numbers.
  - Updated transcendent mode to expose infinite storage/co-processors to AE2 and render them with the infinity symbol in the AE2 terminal.
- **Primitive Distillation Tower**:
  - Reworked the structure to match the GT-Not-Leisure primitive tower layout: 3x3 steel firebox base, five hollow steel hull layers, and a closed steel hull top layer.
  - Fixed the multiblock preview so the tower renders upright instead of lying horizontally.
  - Restricted steam handling to normal steam input or wireless steam input and removed wireless steam output acceptance from the tower structure.
- **Large Steam Multiblocks**:
  - Fixed multiple controller facings that were turned inward, including Large Steam Lathe, Cutting Machine, Extractor, Forming Press, Hammer, and Ore Washer cases.
  - Fixed inverted or swapped structure blocks in several previews/patterns, including Large Steam Hammer and Large Steam Compressor glass/frame placement.
  - Replaced incorrect Solid Machine Casing requirements with Steam Machine Casing where appropriate.
  - Added or expanded Large Steam tooltips with speed, efficiency, parallel, and structure information.
- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Changed the structure requirement from Solid Machine Casing to Steam Machine Casing.
  - Fixed the controller overlay/render path that caused the controller to show as black/pink.
  - Expanded the tooltip to explain water/lava storage, success chance, 60-second runs, ore outputs, and steam venting on failure.
- **Primitive Man's SpaceTime Distortion Device**:
  - Reduced the item model scale without changing the multiblock render.
  - Switched the item texture to the requested `22.png` source texture.
- **Steam Solar Boilers**:
  - Adjusted the Mega Pressure Solar Boiler preview orientation to match the horizontal solar-boiler style better.
- **Custom Hatches**:
  - Changed Overclock Hatch behavior to modify the machine's overclock curve per 4x EU/t instead of acting as a final duration multiplier.
  - Kept Accelerate Hatch as a final post-overclock recipe duration reduction.
  - Updated Overclock Hatch and Accelerate Hatch tooltips to explain the difference clearly for players.

### Fixed
- Fixed Nexus Terminal startup/opening crashes caused by incompatible glass predicate handling in the Nexus ME Hypercore pattern.
- Fixed AE2 Crafting CPU screen crashes when Nexus Hypercore storage exceeded AE2's default byte unit formatting range.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore controller opening while formed by removing heavy module recalculation from UI creation and display refresh paths.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore T5 matrix module counting so full transcendent structures report `481/481`.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore transcendent state showing finite AE2 CPU values instead of the infinity symbol.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore / Crafting CPU Interface disconnecting after relog by persisting CPU storage/co-processor values and reannouncing the virtual CPU after grid reload.
- Fixed a relog server crash where Nexus ME Hypercore sync tried to read the GTCEu multiblock cache before it had been rebuilt.
- Fixed missing or overly abbreviated Nexus ME Hypercore, Crafting CPU Interface, and Infinite Cell Component language entries.
- Fixed Primitive Distillation Tower preview/pattern registration issues that caused `Pattern formed checking failed: gtna:primitive_distillation_tower` during client startup.
- Fixed several Large Steam structures incorrectly accepting wireless steam output hatches where only normal outputs or steam inputs should be valid.
- Fixed missing or overly simple tooltip coverage for newly added steam multiblocks.
- Fixed GTCEu electric multiblocks using automatic abilities, such as the Electric Blast Furnace, not accepting GTNA Accelerate Hatches and Overclock Hatches.
- Fixed GTCEu standard electric multiblocks applying Overclock Hatch duration reduction even when no real energy overclock was available.

### Tested
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `jar reobfJar` after the Nexus ME Hypercore, AE2 CPU, lang, and generated asset changes.
- Confirmed the jar contains the Nexus ME Hypercore machine, Crafting CPU Interface part, AE2 Crafting Service mixin, AE2 Crafting CPU Cluster mixin, CPU Selection List mixin, and Tooltips mixin.
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `runClient` after the latest multiblock and hatch changes.
- Confirmed the client starts without a Primitive Distillation Tower pattern failure after the upright preview fix.
- Ran `compileJava` and `runData` after adding GTNA performance hatches to GTCEu automatic multiblock abilities.
- Ran `compileJava` after correcting Overclock Hatch scaling on GTCEu standard electric multiblocks.
