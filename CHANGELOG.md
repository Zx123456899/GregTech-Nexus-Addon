# Changelog

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-25

### Corrected JAR
- Fixed production startup crashes in the GTCEu module-tooltip and AE2 crafting-confirmation
  mixins. Both now recognize the Minecraft 1.20.1 runtime method names, and missing injection
  targets cannot stop the game from loading.
- Reduced repeated structure checks while the Nexus Terminal builds the Nexus ME Hypercore.
  The target structure is checked once at the end of the build. The in-world build time still
  needs confirmation with the corrected JAR.
- Re-tested startup in a Prism Launcher instance with GTCEu 7.5.3, AE2 15.4.10 and KubeJS
  `2001.6.5-build.26`. The full validation gate passed with 60/60 GameTests.

### Added
- Ported four GTOCore multiblocks: Generator Array, Fishing Ground, Evaporation Plant and
  Greenhouse, with their structures, recipes, casings and English/Portuguese tooltips. The
  Evaporation Plant also has its titanium auxiliary tower.
- Generator Array supports its eligible GTCEu generators and can send power to the Nexus Flux
  Matrix in wireless mode. Fishing Ground includes its bait, water and circuit based catches.
- Added automated formation, recipe, tooltip and behavior checks for the new machines.

### Changed
- Removed Nexus Flux Matrix Safe Mode. Valid energy withdrawals can drain the network to zero;
  old SafeMode save data is ignored and no longer written.
- Wireless Steam Hatches now declare steam specific abilities only. They no longer fill general
  fluid hatch slots in electric multiblocks.
- Clarified Evaporation Plant hatch placement: one fluid input and one or two energy inputs go in
  the base; fluid outputs go in the tower stages. Fluid hatch tier is unrestricted.

### Fixed
- Prevented a startup crash with KubeJS `2001.6.5-build.26` caused by the GTNA DataGenerator
  mixin targeting a missing method name. The injection is now optional and handles the runtime
  method name used by Minecraft 1.20.1.
- Greenhouse sunlight detection now responds to an opaque roof cover and recovers when it is
  removed.
- Revised the four ported machines' tooltips to remove duplicate descriptions and preserve
  source attribution and relevant mechanics in both supported languages.

### Validation
- Passed the full formatting, compilation, unit test, GameTest server and data generation gate.
  The GameTest suite passed all 60 required tests, including a MAX fluid output hatch in a valid
  Evaporation Plant tower stage.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-25

This release expands steam and ore processing, adds multiblock modules and strengthens AE2
autocrafting. It also includes the Structure Terminal improvements, ME Pattern Buffer fixes,
tooltips and automated tests recorded in the continuity ledger.

### Added
- **Electric Blast Furnace module**: a GTNA sub-pattern registered for `gtceu:electric_blast_furnace`
  that adds Parallel / Overclock / Accelerate / Thread hatches to the furnace.
- **KubeJS support for sub-patterns**: the `GTNAServerEvents.subPatterns` server event lets modpack
  creators add module/extension structures to any multiblock (new or existing), unlocking new
  abilities (see `docs/roadmap/sub-patterns.md`).
- **Sub-pattern (module/extension) mechanic** (`ISubPatternMachine` + a `MultiblockControllerMachine`
  mixin): a multiblock can be extended by additional structures attached to the same controller, whose
  parts are merged in to unlock new abilities (e.g. Parallel / Accelerate hatches). Ported in the
  spirit of GTOCore's `addSubPattern`.
- **Liquefaction Furnace** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a coil multiblock that melts an item into a fluid,
  with a stainless-steel extension tower as its sub-pattern.
- **Thermal Power Pump** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a primitive no-energy multiblock that condenses
  steam into water at a biome-dependent rate (rain +50%; the Nether produces nothing).
- **Brick Kiln** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a primitive no-energy multiblock that fires bricks and
  ceramics from compressed clay + coal (parallel 4), closing the ULV era.
- **Integrated Ore Processor** (GTLCore port, LGPLv3): the 6×12×11 stainless/HSSE multiblock that
  collapses the macerate → wash → thermal/sift/centrifuge chain into one recipe per circuit.
- **Advanced Integrated Ore Processor** (GTLCore/TST port, LGPLv3): the 32×12×15 laser-powered,
  effectively unlimited-parallel endgame version.
- **Faithful integrated ore processing recipes**: one recipe per circuit 1..7 for both raw ore and
  stone ore, with the real per-stage byproducts, the material's own washing fluid (distilled water,
  mercury, sodium persulfate, ...) and GTLCore's durations/EUt. The multiplier is configurable
  (`gtna/balance/machines.json` → `integratedOreMultiplier`, default 4 = GTLCore parity).
- **Craft recipes** for the two new multiblocks: Assembler (EV) for the Integrated Ore Processor and
  Assembly Line (UHV) for the Advanced Integrated Ore Processor.

### Changed
- `gtna:ore_processing` now uses GTLCore's IO sizes (2 item in / 9 item out / 1 fluid in).
- **Steam Ore Processing Module**: no longer consumes lubricant; it consumes the washing fluid of the
  matching integrated recipe (circuit 1 needs none; 2/3/4 distilled water; 5/6/7 the ore's fluid).
  Its input filter now only accepts ore/crushed prefixes, not ingots.

### Fixed
- **Steam Ore Processing Module** returned the raw ore unchanged: the recipe lookup passed
  `Ingredient.of(stack)` to GT's recipe DB, which does not expand the item's tags, so tag-based ore
  recipes were never found. It now passes the `ItemStack` (like GT's own `SmartItemFilter`).
- **Addon logo** now shows in every GTNA multiblock UI: a client-only mixin on GTCEu's
  `FancyMachineUIWidget` covers the electric/no-energy/fancy-steam controllers, and the two custom
  310×270 UIs (Nexus ME Hypercore, Nexus Flux Matrix) got an explicit logo.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- **Universal Factory** (GTNA-native port of GTLsupb, LGPLv3): 32 recipe types, cross-recipe
  threads, warmup/overload/batch processing, and the new `universal_factory_casing`.
- **Primitive Stone Furnace** (GTLsupb port): zero-energy multiblock that smelts with effectively
  unlimited threads and parallel.
- **Thread Hatch** wiring: the Industrial Slaughterhouse and the Dimensionally Transcendent Dirt
  Forge are now on the multiple-recipes base and accept the Thread Hatch.
- **Source attribution in tooltips**: ported machines now show `Source: <addon>` (GTO, GTNL, TST,
  GTLsupb, GTOEPP), and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` documents the license of every source.

### Changed
- **Accelerate Hatch**: penalty now uses the recipe's pre-overclock tier (GTO parity — a low-tier
  recipe in a high-tier machine is not punished), the amount is player-configurable, and the
  tooltips follow the GTO wording.
- **Overclock Hatch**: parity with GTOCore (`100 / (tier - 6) %`, configurable).
- **Industrial Slaughterhouse** migrated to `WorkableElectricMultipleRecipesMachine`.
- **Dimensionally Transcendent Dirt Forge** migrated to the multiple-recipes base as a zero-energy
  machine (`getMaxParallel()` = 524288, 1-tick duration).
- **Large Steam Solar Boiler** is the single solar boiler; the duplicate Mega Pressure Solar Boiler
  (class, config, balance, lang, docs and recipes) was removed and the Hyper Pressure Reactor recipe
  now uses the large one.
- Configurable amounts for the Accelerate/Overclock/Thread hatches, with GTO-style tooltips.

### Fixed
- **Output Boost** double application (M→M²) on the multiple-recipes base.
- **Pattern buffer** crashes: tier-index guard in `WorkableElectricMultipleRecipesMachine`
  display text, NPE guard in `PatternSlotResolver`, and scaled-input push in
  `ParallelPatternDetails`.
- **Dedicated server** crash: two client-only leaks in common code.
- **Jade** config translation crash for the pattern buffer provider.
- Nine config options that rendered as raw lang keys.
- Zero-energy parallel computation bypassing GT's `ParallelLogic.getMaxByInput`.

### QA
- GameTest harness plus structure/behaviour tests (16 gametests) and 12 unit tests, all gated in CI.
- `runData` determinism check in CI.

- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Added dedicated Eye of Wood structure data, renderer support, localization, and richer player-facing tooltip text based on the original Twist Space Technology behavior.

### Changed
- **Nexus ME Hypercore / AE2 Integration**:
  - Reworked the Nexus ME Hypercore structure predicates to accept only the required Crafting CPU Interface and Parallel Hatch where appropriate, removing Pattern Buffer acceptance.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore casing/render texture from Magtech casing to GTCEu Nonconducting Casing.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore module counting to use the formed multiblock pattern cache, fixing rotated or larger structure undercounting.
  - Updated Nexus ME Hypercore controller UI to use full labels while abbreviating only large numeric values.
  - Updated AE2 Crafting CPU list formatting so Nexus CPUs use compact storage and co-processor numbers.
  - Updated transcendent mode to expose infinite storage/co-processors to AE2 and render them with the infinity symbol in the AE2 terminal.
- **Primitive Distillation Tower**:
  - Reworked the structure to match the GT-Not-Leisure primitive tower layout: 3x3 steel firebox base, five hollow steel hull layers, and a closed steel hull top layer.
  - Fixed the multiblock preview so the tower renders upright instead of lying horizontally.
  - Restricted steam handling to normal steam input or wireless steam input and removed wireless steam output acceptance from the tower structure.
- **Large Steam Multiblocks**:
  - Fixed multiple controller facings that were turned inward, including Large Steam Lathe, Cutting Machine, Extractor, Forming Press, Hammer, and Ore Washer cases.
  - Fixed inverted or swapped structure blocks in several previews/patterns, including Large Steam Hammer and Large Steam Compressor glass/frame placement.
  - Replaced incorrect Solid Machine Casing requirements with Steam Machine Casing where appropriate.
  - Added or expanded Large Steam tooltips with speed, efficiency, parallel, and structure information.
- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Changed the structure requirement from Solid Machine Casing to Steam Machine Casing.
  - Fixed the controller overlay/render path that caused the controller to show as black/pink.
  - Expanded the tooltip to explain water/lava storage, success chance, 60-second runs, ore outputs, and steam venting on failure.
- **Primitive Man's SpaceTime Distortion Device**:
  - Reduced the item model scale without changing the multiblock render.
  - Switched the item texture to the requested `22.png` source texture.
- **Steam Solar Boilers**:
  - Adjusted the Mega Pressure Solar Boiler preview orientation to match the horizontal solar-boiler style better.
- **Custom Hatches**:
  - Changed Overclock Hatch behavior to modify the machine's overclock curve per 4x EU/t instead of acting as a final duration multiplier.
  - Kept Accelerate Hatch as a final post-overclock recipe duration reduction.
  - Updated Overclock Hatch and Accelerate Hatch tooltips to explain the difference clearly for players.

### Fixed

- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore controller opening while formed by removing heavy module recalculation from UI creation and display refresh paths.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore T5 matrix module counting so full transcendent structures report `481/481`.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore transcendent state showing finite AE2 CPU values instead of the infinity symbol.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore / Crafting CPU Interface disconnecting after relog by persisting CPU storage/co-processor values and reannouncing the virtual CPU after grid reload.
- Fixed a relog server crash where Nexus ME Hypercore sync tried to read the GTCEu multiblock cache before it had been rebuilt.
- Fixed missing or overly abbreviated Nexus ME Hypercore, Crafting CPU Interface, and Infinite Cell Component language entries.
- Fixed Primitive Distillation Tower preview/pattern registration issues that caused `Pattern formed checking failed: gtna:primitive_distillation_tower` during client startup.
- Fixed several Large Steam structures incorrectly accepting wireless steam output hatches where only normal outputs or steam inputs should be valid.
- Fixed missing or overly simple tooltip coverage for newly added steam multiblocks.
- Fixed GTCEu electric multiblocks using automatic abilities, such as the Electric Blast Furnace, not accepting GTNA Accelerate Hatches and Overclock Hatches.
- Fixed GTCEu standard electric multiblocks applying Overclock Hatch duration reduction even when no real energy overclock was available.

### Tested
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `jar reobfJar` after the Nexus ME Hypercore, AE2 CPU, lang, and generated asset changes.
- Confirmed the jar contains the Nexus ME Hypercore machine, Crafting CPU Interface part, AE2 Crafting Service mixin, AE2 Crafting CPU Cluster mixin, CPU Selection List mixin, and Tooltips mixin.
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `runClient` after the latest multiblock and hatch changes.
- Confirmed the client starts without a Primitive Distillation Tower pattern failure after the upright preview fix.
